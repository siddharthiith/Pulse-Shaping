# Pulse-Shaping

In this project we did pulse shaping for DVBS2 standard used in satellite transmission. We transmit certain number of qpsk symbol in which noise gets added and ISI(inter symbol interferance) also occurs. Then at receiver end we need to do matched filtering for guessing the corresponding symbol. Next, we plot the Probability of error vs SNR for it.
